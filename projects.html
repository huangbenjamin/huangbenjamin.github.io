        Personal Website
      </h3>
      <p>
        You are here! This website is a way for me to get more experience with
        HTML and CSS, as well as to put myself out there. It's not much, but I
        hope it'll do. I'll add more stuff here when I actually have stuff to
        put here. Feel free to browse around!

        Music Production
      </h3>
      <p>
        I publish contemporary Christian and electronic music to Spotify under
        the alias Quake. You can check out my music on
        <a
          class="navlinks"
          target="_new"
          href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/55qm7kb8OAj4XE06xMNhxT"
          >Spotify</a
        >! You can also find links to my YouTube channel and SoundCloud account
        in the <a class="navlinks" href="./contact">contact tab</a>. I've
        been producing music using FL Studio for around 4 years now, but only
        started uploading to Spotify relatively recently. Feel free to listen to
        some previews below, hope you enjoy! Full versions can be found at the
        aforementioned link.

      <h3>
        Waterloo Basics
      </h3>
      <p>
        Something exciting I've been working on with a small team of other
        engineering students at the University of Waterloo! It's a website
        designed to help those interested in applying for UW engineering or
        incoming UW engineering students as a collection of resources and
        information pooled from many other sources and put together in one place
        for their convenience. The website is live
        <a class="navlinks" href="https://waterloobasics.github.io">here</a>,
        though still a work in progress. Feel free to check it out! We hope you
        find it useful.
